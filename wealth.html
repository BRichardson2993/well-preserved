        <h3>Three Simple Ways to Improve Your Retirement Planning</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>1. Revise your budget at the year&rsquo;s beginning.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Ask yourself: How do I spend my money? How do I protect my health? Many of us believe we have a reasonable idea of where we put our money, but unless you account for your spending, you may miss out by not putting away enough for your happy retirement. And, putting into place the Medicare coverage that best suits your needs.</p>
            <p>A household&rsquo;s discretionary spending on nonessential goods and services like a second smart phone case or the premier movie channel could top 30 percent. And that is often twice what you intended— but you don&rsquo;t see it until you budget.</p>
            <p>Budgeting puts you in the driver&rsquo;s seat. From there you can control where you spend. You&rsquo;re buying on purpose, and sometimes you get a nice surprise. That alluring vacation is now within reach.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>2. Be proactive about your financial interests.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Learning about which financial products may work best for your personal needs and how to protect your hard-earned money from unnecessary taxation is not what most laypeople excel at. That job is best handled by working with a professional. But, as with your health, you reap the benefits of being aware of your needs and of initiating the process of looking after yourself.</p>
            <p>Remember, 40 percent of retirees underestimate their life expectancy, according to an Ernst &amp; Young study. So if you don&rsquo;t want to run out of money, create your financial plan to cover this extended retirement period. Then, your odds for a comfortable retirement are improved.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>3. Consider alternatives to stocks, bonds and cash.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Many new investment types have appeared to solve planning and retirement issues. Yet most investors limit their choices by relying exclusively on stocks, bonds and cash.</p>
            <p>From 2000 to 2013, the stock market, for all its ups and downs, wound up at roughly the same place, around 1527. At a 2 to 3 percent investment cost per year, many investors, for all their efforts, lost money!</p>
            <p>The Well Preserved Advisory Group educates our clients by showing diverse Medicare and financial planning options to achieve your retirement goals. We customize a plan to suit your needs to preserve your health, wealth and freedom to live the way you choose.</p>
