        <h3>Are you prepared for when a tornado warning is issued?</h3>
        <p>by Anja Mottern, ARM</p>
        <p>We are approaching the time of year when the winds pick up and people start talking about tornados. If a tornado siren goes off are you ready? Do you have a plan of action? Most people in Oklahoma are familiar with what to do in a tornado but every now and then we need a refresher. Below are some tips for when a tornado watch or warning is issued in your area:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you have all of your important documents stored in an easily accessible bag. This way should a disaster happen you have your insurance policy, important numbers, pills, etc.</li>
          <li>Have a tornado emergency plan set up. In this plan you should know where the closest shelter or safe place for you to go is.</li>
          <li>Make sure that your cell phone is charged and that you have plenty of batteries, flashlights and candles.</li>
          <li>Know the difference between a watch and a warning. A watch indicates the possibility of a tornado and a warning means one has been spotted in the area.</li>
          <li>Have bottled water and nonperishable items available in case you are in a shelter for a long period of time.</li>
          <li>If you live in an apartment community make sure to check with the manager to see where the shelters are located in the building.</li>
          <li>Be aware of your neighbors and check to see if any of them need additional assistance.</li>
          <li>Make sure to listen to the radio and/or news to keep up to date. If you have a smartphone you can download a weather app to track the storms as well.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is very important to take the weather conditions seriously and be proactive versus reactive. Your safety is the most important thing and being too cautious is better than ignoring signs!</p>
